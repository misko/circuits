"""G-*: the gate that governs the gates.

`contracts_audit.py` governs FOLDERS. Nothing governed the CHECKERS — so five of
them shipped unable to fail on the property they name, and a fleet audit found
two boards not orderable with every gate green:

  * A-AMP graded 10 of 57 declared net-class currents fleet-wide; usb-hub-3s-v3's
    PWR_IN 7 A, PWR_RAIL 6 A and SWITCH_NODE 7 A are all silenced by a qualifier,
    and the one class it does grade FAILS.
  * `row_kind` dropped RS1/RS2 (the shunts setting both buck current limits) and
    CE1 (the only electrolytic, which shipped reversed) while printing PASS.
  * `labeled_resistance("10mOhm")` returns 1.0e7 — milli decoded as mega.

The acceptance test for the auditor itself is ADVERSARIAL and lives in
`t_flags_the_scripts_independently_known_broken` below: it must flag the two
scripts we already know are silent. A gate-on-gates that comes back clean on a
codebase measured to be riddled is decoration.
