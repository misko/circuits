# contract: skills/kicad-pcb/scripts/

**Purpose** — the shared executable backend and checkers. A board carries
CONFIG, not code: anything a specific board needs beyond these scripts is a
BACKEND GAP to report, not a bespoke script to write here.

## Allowed

| Pattern | What |
|---|---|
| `*.py` | generators, checkers, converters — run with `/usr/bin/python3` (pcbnew) |
| `*.sh` | drivers (e.g. `tsx_to_board.sh`) |
| `contracts.md` | this file |

## Audit

- Each script's module docstring states purpose + usage; incident references
  cite board NAMES/commits as provenance, never `projects/...` paths
  (contracts_audit C-ISO).
- Checkers: clean + known-bad tests in `tests/` (see tests/README.md — the
  known-bad count is the number that matters).
- Generators emit artifacts that downstream gates re-measure independently
  (canon M1: checker and checked share no method).

## Structure

One file per tool; no package/`__init__.py` — scripts are invoked by path.
`__pycache__/` is gitignored, never committed.
