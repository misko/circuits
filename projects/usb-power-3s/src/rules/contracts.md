# contract: src/rules/

**Purpose** — design intent that must be MACHINE-ENFORCED. Intent that only
a human reads belongs in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`; intent a tool must check
belongs here.

**Mutability** — hand-edited. This is source; `.kicad_dru` and the
`.kicad_pro` netclasses are its OUTPUT.

## Allowed

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `nets.yaml` | net classes: nets, current, intent, min_width, routing strategy, verify, scoped exemptions |
| `stackup.yaml` | layer count, what each layer is for, fab tier (optional) |
| `contracts.md` | this file |

## The rule that makes this folder worth existing

**`intent` and `min_width` come from the same file, so they cannot drift.**
When they lived apart — classes in `.kicad_pro`, intent in a human's head —
both 6A switch nodes got routed at 0.15mm and DRC had no basis to object.

Corollary: **define classes and floors BEFORE routing, never after.** With
floors in place a router's thin-pass output fails DRC immediately.
Retrofitting them cost a full repair campaign.

## Structure: `nets.yaml`

Each class requires: `intent` (prose, why this net is special), `nets` (list
or patterns), `min_width`, `routing` (pour vs track, and the strategy),
`verify` (how to prove it). `current` where >1A. `exemptions` are scoped to
NAMED RULE AREAS that exist on the board — never a blanket carve-out.

Floors are BACKSTOPS, not sizing: trunk current rides pours and planes. The
floor's job is to make "silently thin" impossible, not to carry the amps.

## Validate

- every net in `nets.yaml` exists in the netlist (else the class is a no-op)
- every net carrying >1A per `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s power tree appears in
  some class here — an unclassed high-current net is a BUG
- regenerating produces byte-identical `.kicad_dru` + `.kicad_pro`
  netclasses (drift = someone hand-edited the output)
- every `exemptions[].area` names a rule area that exists on the board
- DRC width comparisons are EXACT NANOMETERS: a track at 249800nm prints as
  "0.25" and fails a 0.25mm floor. Round emitted values.

## Repair

- Net in `nets.yaml` but not the netlist → stale; remove it or fix the name.
- High-current net with no class → add it; do not lower the floor to match
  the copper.
- Hand-edit found in `.kicad_dru` → port to `nets.yaml`, regenerate.
