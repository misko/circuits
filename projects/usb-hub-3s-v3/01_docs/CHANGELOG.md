# Changelog — usb-hub-3s-v3

Board internal name `usb_hub_3s_v2`; project directory `usb-hub-3s-v3`.

## v1.0 — 2026-07-22

Released: `07_releases/v1.0-2026-07-22/`

First orderable release. 3S-LiPo powered 3-port USB hub (3× USB-A 5 V + 1×
Pi-dedicated USB-C 5 V/5 A), 4-layer, 130.1 × 92.1 mm, XT60 input →
10 A MINI-blade fuse → dual synchronous LM5116 bucks.

Gates at seal (git_sha in `MANIFEST.txt`, `git_dirty: false`):
- DRC 0/0/0 (severity-all, refill-zones, schematic-parity); source/ re-measures
  0/0/0 standalone (V-REL-FPLIB).
- policy_audit 0 FAIL (PASS=19, WAIVED=1 R-THERM evidence-backed, HUMAN=6, N-A=9).
- E-INV / E-ADR / E-TOPO PASS; P-LAYOUT / P-ADJ PASS.
- JLC digital twin exit 0 (80 OK / 209 checked; all criticals adjudicated).
- Pin review PASS, render review PASS.
- Red-team **topology: ORDER** — the original memo's DO-NOT-ORDER was a pre-fix
  snapshot driven solely by P1 RT-T1 (fuse 20 A→10 A, fixed `071fe56`); an
  independent zero-context re-review returned ORDER and re-confirmed the 10 A
  sizing (`verification/…_topology_rereview.md`, `verification/RT-T1_regate_note.md`).
- Red-team **layout: ORDER**, zero P0/P1.

Key decisions carried in this release:
- USB-C port is Pi-dedicated; needs `PSU_MAX_CURRENT=5000` on the Pi 5 EEPROM
  for 5 A (ADR-0001).
- F1 10 A MINI blade element is hand-fit (off-CPL); the Keystone-3568 holder
  (C5249699) is JLC-placed.
- F-2.1 (LM5116 UVLO ≈ 9.65 V cold-start > 9.0 V nominal) accepted as a
  documented P2 per user decision (doubles as LiPo deep-discharge protection).
- P2 next-rev work order (RT-T2/T4/T5, AON6354 doc hygiene, LM5116 EP via-arrays
  + VBAT_F B.Cu pour) recorded in `ORDER_README.md`; none blocks this order.
