# contract: 03_src/rules/

**Purpose** — design intent that must be MACHINE-ENFORCED. Intent that only
a human reads belongs in `01_docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`; intent a tool must check
belongs here.

**Mutability** — hand-edited. This is source; `.kicad_dru` and the
`.kicad_pro` netclasses are its OUTPUT.

## Allowed

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `nets.yaml` | net classes: nets, current, intent, min_width, routing strategy, verify, scoped exemptions; `fab_tier` (capability floors for the generic backend); `scoped_floors` (insideArea width relaxations, `why` REQUIRED) |
| `electrical_invariants.yaml` | design-INTENT assertions the netlist must satisfy (canon E-INV): `pin_on_net`, `series_chain`, `net_has_part`. Each REQUIRES `adr:` (the ADR that emitted it) + `why:`. Emitted by protection/topology ADRs; graded by `electrical_invariants.py` |
| `power_tree.yaml` | per-rail voltage ENVELOPES + converter selection (canon E-TOPO): `{name, vin_min, vin_max, vout_min, vout_max, iout_max_A, converter, eff}`. Topology is DERIVED from Vin-vs-Vout (buck/boost/buck_boost) and asserted against the converter part.yaml `type:`; over-capable = over-engineering FAIL. Graded by `power_topology.py` |
| `stackup.yaml` | layer count, what each layer is for, fab tier (optional) |
| `twin_adjudications.yaml` | reviewed jlc_twin findings accepted WITH evidence (see jlcpcb-fab skill) |
| `passives_lcsc.yaml` | passives BOM-comment -> LCSC seed map (bom_seed input; usb-hub-3s) |
| `policy_waivers.yaml` | policy_audit waivers accepted WITH measurement evidence (canon M4/M-WAIV): a YAML list, each entry naming the WAIVED S-/P-/R-/M-/E- policy ID + `why:` + the measurement that justifies it; P-ADJ net-span over-budget dispositions land here with the measured span + why. An entry without evidence is itself a FAIL |
| `policy_audit.json` | OPTIONAL `policy_audit.py` config (`--config 03_src/rules/policy_audit.json`, its default path): thresholds + HUMAN-item verdict pointers (S5/S6/S7) |
| `critical_parts.yaml` | selective accepted facts for catastrophic part/footprint identities and geometry; graded by `critical_part_facts.py` before routing |
| `contracts.md` | this file |

## The rule that makes this folder worth existing

**`intent` and `min_width` come from the same file, so they cannot drift.**
When they lived apart — classes in `.kicad_pro`, intent in a human's head —
both 6A switch nodes got routed at 0.15mm and DRC had no basis to object.

Corollary: **define classes and floors BEFORE routing, never after.** With
floors in place a router's thin-pass output fails DRC immediately.
Retrofitting them cost a full repair campaign.

## Structure: `nets.yaml`

Each class requires: `intent` (prose, why this net is special), `nets` (list
or patterns), `min_width`, `routing` (pour vs track, and the strategy),
`verify` (how to prove it). `current` where >1A. `exemptions` are scoped to
NAMED RULE AREAS that exist on the board — never a blanket carve-out.

Top-level `scoped_floors:` (canon M8 promotion of the hand-appended
insideArea rules) is the machine-enforced form of a scoped exemption:
`{zone, nets, min_width, why}` — the generic emitter writes it as a
last-match `.kicad_dru` rule after the netclass floors. `why` is REQUIRED
(canon M4); `min_width` must still clear the declared tier's `min_track`.

Top-level `fab_tier:` is also the SINGLE SOURCE of capability floors for
the generic backend (`fab_tier_util.py`): class widths, route/stitch/tap
via geometry and silk text heights are floored/derived from it, and
explicit sub-floor values are generation errors naming the tier.

Floors are BACKSTOPS, not sizing: trunk current rides pours and planes. The
floor's job is to make "silently thin" impossible, not to carry the amps.

## Validate

- every net in `nets.yaml` exists in the netlist (else the class is a no-op)
- every net carrying >1A per `01_docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s power tree appears in
  some class here — an unclassed high-current net is a BUG
- regenerating produces byte-identical `.kicad_dru` + `.kicad_pro`
  netclasses (drift = someone hand-edited the output)
- every `exemptions[].area` names a rule area that exists on the board
- every `policy_waivers.yaml` entry parses, names a real policy ID, and carries
  `why:` + measurement evidence (canon M-WAIV)
- DRC width comparisons are EXACT NANOMETERS: a track at 249800nm prints as
  "0.25" and fails a 0.25mm floor. Round emitted values.

## Repair

- Net in `nets.yaml` but not the netlist → stale; remove it or fix the name.
- High-current net with no class → add it; do not lower the floor to match
  the copper.
- Hand-edit found in `.kicad_dru` → port to `nets.yaml`, regenerate.
